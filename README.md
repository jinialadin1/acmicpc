# Algorithm & Data Structure practice

This is the practice repository for algorithm and data structure study.  
Our study book is **[알고리즘 문제 해결 전략](https://book.algospot.com/index.html)** and we will study 2 chapters per month.
Basic language of our study is C++ but it doesn't matter to use JAVA or other language instead. Although our book introduces the pseudo-algorithm as C++, so I strongly recommend using C++ std11.


# Code Convention

We don't have code convention because every team has difference convention so it is unnecessary to force it.  
However, if you want to use specific convention, I recommend [MS DotNet](https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) convention.

# Upload your code

Every week, we will solve real problem in [백준 알고리즘 그룹](https://www.acmicpc.net/group/practice/2014/14). Every practice set will have at least 3 problems and at most 5 problems. Practice will start every Saturday, and it will end on Wednesday midnight.  
  
We will review our code after the practice end, so please commit your code file 

## Folder name

You have to commit your code in proper name.  
Every week, there will be a new folder name **MMDDYY**.  
Please upload your code in the folder as *NAME_SET.PROBLEM#.cpp* (ex) hj_1.cpp  
  
For your convenience, I recommend you to use **"bits/stdc++.h"** which include all useful headers to solve problem.

In the **prac** folder, you can upload your code that you just solve it for your own study.


# Study Case
 - [Brute Force 020120](https://github.com/jinialadin1/acmicpc/tree/master/020120)
	 - we learn how to solve problem by finding every possible path.  
	 It might be slow (which menas time complexity of code is larger than **O(N^2)**)  
	 but easy to understand, and can be an effectivie start point to find new algorithm
